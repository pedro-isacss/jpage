## Get Started
JPage is a JavaScript plugin for creating websites as slides.

To use JPage in your project, you must add to it:

**CSS**
```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jpage@{version}/lib/index.css"/>
```

**JAVASCRIPT**
```html
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jpage@{version}/lib/index.js" type="module"></script>
```

> replace {version} with the desired version (you can consult all versions of JPage by [clicking here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jpage)).

**NOTE:** if you don't want to use CDN in your project, you can download JPage and use it directly by clicking on the download buttons available in the header.
