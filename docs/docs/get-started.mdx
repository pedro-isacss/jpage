## How Does It Work?

To start using **JPage**, you need to include both the JavaScript and CSS files in your project. This can easily be done by embedding the necessary resources via the **jsDelivr** CDN. Follow the steps below to integrate JPage into your website.

## Step 1: Include the JPage CSS and JavaScript Files

Use the following code to include the **CSS** and **JavaScript** files from the CDN.

**CSS**

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jpage@{version}/lib/index.min.css"
/>
```

**JavaScript**

```html
<script
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jpage@{version}/lib/index.min.js"
  type="module"
></script>
```

> replace `{version}` with the desired version number (you can check all available versions of JPage by [clicking here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jpage?activeTab=versions)).

## Step 2: Basic Usage

```html
<div class="jpage">
  <div class="section" style="background-color: crimson;">
    <!-- Your content for Section 1 -->
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <div class="slider">
      <div class="slide" style="background-color: brown;">
        <!-- Your content for Slide 1 in Section 2 -->
      </div>
      <div class="slide" style="background-color: dimgray;">
        <!-- Your content for Slide 2 in Section 2 -->
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<script>
  const jpageConfig = {}; // Object to configure JPage
</script>
```

In this example, you create two sections:

- The first section has a single slide with a red background.
- The second section includes a slider with two slides, one brown and one gray.
