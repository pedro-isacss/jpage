**Scroller** and **Slider** are the two main components of JPage. The Scroller is responsible for vertical scrolling, while the Slider handles horizontal scrolling.

## Scroller

The Scroller is composed of sections. To create a Scroller, simply add the `section` class to a container:

```html
<div class="section">
  <!-- Your content -->
</div>
```

You can customize the Scroller's behavior by defining the following options in the configuration object:

```javascript
const jpageConfig = {
  scroller: {
    showControls: true, // Whether controls should be shown or not
    waitingTime: 400, // Waiting time for scrolling (in milliseconds)
    duration: 700, // Scroll duration time (in milliseconds)
  },
};
```

- **showControls**: If set to `true`, navigation controls will be displayed.
- **waitingTime**: The time to wait before starting the scroll action after a user interaction.
- **duration**: The time it takes for the scroll animation to complete.

## Slider

The Slider consists of slides and is placed within a section of the Scroller. To create a Slider, use the following structure:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="slider">
    <div class="slide">
      <!-- Your content -->
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
      <!-- Your content -->
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Similar to the Scroller, you can customize the Slider by specifying options in the configuration object:

```javascript
const jpageConfig = {
  slider: {
    showControls: true, // Whether controls should be shown or not
    duration: 700, // Slider duration time (in milliseconds)
  },
};
```

- **showControls**: If set to `true`, navigation controls for the slides will be displayed.
- **duration**: The time it takes for the slide transition animation to complete.
