If you need to add additional content but you don't want to use either the Scroller or the Slider, then you can use After Sections.

```html
<div class="jpage">
  <div class="after-sections">
    <!-- Your content here -->
  </div>
</div>
```

> **Important:** add the After Sections component after all sections!

import AfterSectionsPreview from "../../components/AfterSectionsPreview";

<AfterSectionsPreview />
